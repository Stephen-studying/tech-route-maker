# Output Options

Use this reference when choosing or explaining output formats. Use default presets first, and ask only when a missing choice would materially change the output.

Primary users are academic and engineering users who need editable paper, thesis, proposal, defense, method-framework, system, workflow, and engineering route diagrams. Campaign diagrams are legacy/experimental and should be used only when the user explicitly asks for them.

## Format menu

| id | File | Editable in | Strength | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pptx | `tech-route.pptx` | PowerPoint, WPS | Best for presentations and defenses | Must use native shapes, text, and lines |
| svg | `tech-route.svg` | Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape, browser | Best for high-resolution vector editing | Keep text/vector elements editable |
| drawio | `tech-route.drawio` | diagrams.net | Best for long-term technical maintenance | Use `mxCell` nodes and edges |
| excalidraw | `tech-route.excalidraw` | Excalidraw | Best for whiteboard review and lightweight edits | Use scene JSON, not an image |
| mermaid | `tech-route.mmd` | Any text editor, GitHub Markdown | Best for version control | Visual control is limited |
| html | `tech-route.html` | Browser and code editor | Best for interactive previews | Include node detail and evidence data |
| markdown | `TECH_ROUTE.md` | Any Markdown editor | Best for README/docs | Include Mermaid and evidence tables |
| json | `tech-route.json` | Any text editor | Best for re-rendering and theme changes | Treat as the source of truth |
| all | all of the above | mixed | Best for archival handoff | Slower and more files |

## Default selection rule

Use these defaults unless the user asks for advanced choices:

- Editable presentation figure: `pptx,svg,json`
- Paper or research figure: `svg,pptx,json`
- Maintainable system diagram: `drawio,svg,json`
- Documentation output: `markdown,mermaid,json`
- Long-term maintenance: add `drawio`
- Full archive: `pptx,svg,drawio,excalidraw,mermaid,html,markdown,json`

Ask one clarification question only when the target output is genuinely ambiguous.

## Source patterns

Public roadmap guidance emphasizes editable, reusable, and audience-specific outputs:
- ProductPlan frames technology roadmaps as high-level visual summaries for complex technology work and recommends audience-aware detail levels.
- Smartsheet describes roadmap outputs for migration, unifying systems, continuity, upgrades, and new infrastructure.
- Miro and Canva emphasize template selection, customization, collaboration, milestones, dependencies, and visual communication.
- diagrams.net uses an XML-based editable diagram format and can export SVG/PDF/PNG.

Use these as design patterns, not as copied template assets.
